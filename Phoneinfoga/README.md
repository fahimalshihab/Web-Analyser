# PhoneInfoga

PhoneInfoga is an open-source information-gathering tool designed for gathering various details about a phone number. It is primarily used for reconnaissance and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) purposes. PhoneInfoga utilizes public data sources, such as online databases, search engines, and APIs, to retrieve information associated with a phone number.

The tool can provide a wide range of information, including the carrier name, country of origin, line type (e.g., mobile or landline), geographical location (city and state), and even details about the phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number. It can also gather data from popular social media platforms and perform reconnaissance on associated email addresses.

PhoneInfoga is commonly used by security researchers, penetration testers, and individuals conducting investigations to gather preliminary information about a phone number and its related metadata. However, it's essential to use such tools responsibly and in compliance with relevant legal and ethical guidelines to respect privacy and data protection regulations.
